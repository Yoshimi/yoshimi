## Yoshimi

Yoshimi is a software audio synthesizer, originally forked from [ZynAddSubFX](https://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.io/). 

### Current version

Version 2.3.0 - Painted Bunting

* There's been a major overhaul of the graphics for better visibility.
* We've added a very complete user-definable colour theme system.
* There is indication when any rotary control or slider is not at its default.
* Many controls are now high resolution yet both forward and backward compatible with older Yoshimi versions.
* All the documentation has been revised.
