Packages known to be needed to build in debian jessie and later.
Some of these will pull in other ones.

    automake
    build-essential    * we now require C++17
    cmake-curses-gui   * 3.0 or later
    fluid              * not needed if compiling headless
    libcairo2-dev      * not needed if compiling headless
    libfftw3-dev
    libfltk1.3-dev     * not needed if compiling headless
    libglu1-mesa-dev   * not needed if compiling headless
    libjack-jackd2-dev * not needed if not compiling for Jack
    libasound2-dev
    libmxml-dev
    libncurses-dev
    libreadline-dev
    libxft-dev
    libxml2-dev
    pkg-config
    xutils-dev
    zlib1g-dev

If compiling for LV2:

    lv2-dev            * libjack-jackd2-dev also required for this

Other distros may have slightly different names or version numbers, and may even have these installed by default. If in doubt try looking for just the main part of the name, but with the -dev extension where appropriate.


For experienced builders:

Optional alternative, instead of libncurses-dev. only needed for wide (unicode) character recognition. Note the 'w'!
    libncursesw-dev

Optional alternative to glibc, part of build-essential
    musl

This also requires argp-standalone which is not available from debian and must be built from source.

Note:
    argp-standalone is also needed for BSD builds.
