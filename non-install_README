Once complied, the Yoshimi image can be run from anywhere in the file system, but if it is not installed to the normal locations it will be unable to find the default banks, the user guide and other documents.

These can be copied to suitable locations in .local by running:
'sh copydocs.sh' from *this* directory.

You can do this either before or after building, but should do so before the first run of Yoshimi.
