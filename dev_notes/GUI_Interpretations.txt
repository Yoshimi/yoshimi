string          name - handled via simple message system.

Elsewhere, unused chars are set to 0xff as a general test.

e.g.
If 'part' is 0xf0 (main) and 'kit' is 0xff you're there and it is main volume, key shift etc.

If part is < 0x40 and kit is 0xff it's the general part level controls.

If part is < 0x40 and insert = 0x20 it's the kit engine enable controls.

Microtonal (scales)
This uses part number 0xe8

Midi Learn
This uses part number 0xd8

Vector Control
This uses part number 0xc0

Effects and effect sources.
In 'part' we use 0xf1 for system effects and 0xf2 for insertion effects. For these and normal part effects, 'kit' ORed with 0x80 is used to denote the effect type (reverb echo etc.) and 'engine' is used to denote the number of the effect being worked on (the limit depends on the effect source). As 'kit' and 'engine' are not relevant for effects it is safe to use them here.

Effects 'kit' numbers offset by 0x80.

These can't be inserts, as Dynfilter has Filter as an insert!
