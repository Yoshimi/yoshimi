This structure is intended to enable you to traverse the controls structure testing/adjusting at each level on the tree.

The function will be called directly with a command block and return 'value' and 'type' set appropriately.

'type' will be used to determine the operation.

values (& 3)
0   return adjusted input to max and min.
1   return min
2   return default
3   return max

flags
bit 2   undefined
bit 3   from midi
bit 4   from cli
bit 5   from gui
bit 6   (returns) MIDI-learnable
bit 7   (returns) regard as integer

Normal byte structure will be used to determine how far down the tree to go for a value.

e.g.
      value  type  command  part
limit  200     0      0     240 {remainder all 255}

This would return 127 - the input value adusted to the maximium for master volume.

limit  any     3     255     0 {remainder all 255}

No command set so it returns 64 - the maximim number of ordinary parts.


If an out of range setting is found part way along a command chain. 'value' will be set to the byte number where the error was encountered and 'type' will be set to 255.

e.g
'part' was set to 70 (invalid part number)
'value' will be returned as 2

'part' set to 3 (valid) but control set to 200 (no such control at this level)
'value' will be returned as 1
