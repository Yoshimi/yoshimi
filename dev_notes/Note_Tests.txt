This is a new test facility for checking note on and note off behaviour. It is disabled by default and enabled at compile time in ccmake as "ReportNotes".

When enabled it continually checks that all notes at their entry to Yoshimi are passed on the the actual note on/off code and reports any differences to the reports console or stdio (whichever is selected).

When working entirely within jack (including LV2) there should be no messages at all, but if using ALSA for either MIDI or audio there will sometimes be a few different depending on the complexity due to the buffering action.

At any time hitting the GUI stop button will report the totals, but bear in mind this report is done *before* the stop cleanup so will show any notes that were still hanging at the time stop was hit.

When you stop playing or a MIDI file has finished is the best time to check. You will then see the totals and there should be none shown as hanging.

The master reset will zero all of these figures.

Yoshimi's virtual keyboard is not supported by this system and will actually produce negative numbers!
