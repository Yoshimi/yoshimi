still not fully converted:
    vectors
    root, bank, instrument loads & saves

pasting effect doesn't update effect title.

Requested: revise window states so engines etc can be made auto open.

Do a dual scan for banks so that IDd ones are found first, then any new ones picked up on the second scan. This stops known ones being re-ordered.

Allow both jack and alsa midi at the same time?

NRPN channels?

Fl::check() used too liberally. See where it can be removed - controls updating multiple windows seem the be the main problem.

Expand midi-learn to include:
    more switches
    learn groups
    GUI view by group but CLI and running search only by CC & chan

Make NRPN midi learn able to be re-learned.

LV2: internal sound banks do not appear to be exposed as LV2 presets

Make add voice & add/pad oscillator and resonance windows show kit number & name.

Make vector window update when main window reduces number of available parts.

Consider, Pitchwheel split range in Controllers, but that one seems a bit pointless to me!

Change root/bank/instrument lists to single file for all instances.

Make loading effect presets update the 'top' line.

Startup state load doesn't set buffersize correctly - partially resolved. Size is ignored if loaded when already running (which is reasonable).

Allow headless compilation.

Make things like Echo delay either floats or much higher resolution.

Consider enabling and disabling tooltips.

Make attempt to start second independent instance open a new one in running yoshimi instead - saves memory and more consistent.

Possible single state file (for standalone) including all currently open instances,

RPNs (channel based)

101,0 (MSB)

100,0 Pitch bend range
100,1 Fine detune
100,2 Coarse detune

Improve Copy & Paste functionality.
