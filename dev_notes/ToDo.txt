Realtime subnote

bw & amp calculations in initfilterbank/initfilter can be copied out to new routine.

In normal sync apply if changed. Later add interpolation.
Hmmm, looks like we need to do the whole filterbank :(
Need to find out how long it takes!

Approx 4uS, but it's not as simple as that :(

Edit button
+1 to 8 open addsynth voice window - could be 'interesting' :(

Unchecking volume in controllers works correctly but still changes the GUI controls :(

Requested: auto 'apply' timer for padsynth.

Do a dual scan for banks so that IDd ones are found first, then any new ones picked up on the second scan. This stops known ones being re-ordered when 'foreign' entries appear from outside Yoshimi.

Bug! If jack is selected for audio but there are no physical ports Yoshimi quits with CLI warning - should run with gui warning as well or better still loop back to try alsa.

Pasting effect doesn't update effect title.

Requested: revise window states so engines etc can be made auto open.

NRPN channels?

Expand MIDI-learn to include:
    learn groups
    GUI view by group but CLI and running search only by CC & chan

Make NRPN MIDI-learn able to be re-learned.

LV2: internal sound banks do not appear to be exposed as LV2 presets

Make add voice & add/pad oscillator and resonance windows show kit number & name.

Make vector window update when main window reduces number of available parts.

Consider, Pitchwheel split range in Controllers, but that one seems a bit pointless to me!

Change root/bank/instrument lists to single file for all instances.

Make loading effect presets update the 'top' line.

Startup state load doesn't set buffersize correctly - partially resolved. Size is ignored if loaded when already running (which is reasonable).

Allow headless compilation.

Make things like Echo delay either floats or much higher resolution.

Consider enabling and disabling tooltips.

Make attempt to start second independent instance open a new one in running yoshimi instead - saves memory and more consistent.
Also, add CLI command to start new instance from within running Yoshimi

Possible single state file (for standalone) including all currently open instances,

RPNs (channel based)

101,0 (MSB)

100,0 Pitch bend range
100,1 Fine detune
100,2 Coarse detune

Improve Copy & Paste functionality.
