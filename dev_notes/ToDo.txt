BUG! Multi instances produce jack errors when main instance closed, even if they have been closed first - been there since V 1.4.1 :(

BUG! If jack is selected for audio but there are no physical ports Yoshimi quits with CLI warning - should run with gui warning as well, or better still loop back to try alsa.

Maybe BUG crash when loading files from banks - cured by clearing an recreating config files.

Revise GUI voice list related to voice editor.

Sort out bank properly.

Sort out cli part effect controls. Also sys/ins updates wrong.

Find out why reporting errors in 'Bank' is very slow.

Realtime subnote

Zero-cross for note off.

Add 'Lock AddSynth Oscillator' checkbox to settings.

Edit button
+1 to 8 open addsynth voice window - could be 'interesting' :(

Requested: auto 'apply' timer for padsynth.

Do a dual scan for banks so that IDd ones are found first, then any new ones picked up on the second scan. This stops known ones being re-ordered when 'foreign' entries appear from outside Yoshimi.

Pasting effect doesn't update effect title.

Requested: revise window states so engines etc can be made auto open.

Expand MIDI-learn to include:
    learn groups
    GUI view by group but CLI and running search only by CC & chan

Make NRPN MIDI-learn able to be re-learned.

LV2: internal sound banks do not appear to be exposed as LV2 presets

Consider, Pitchwheel split range in Controllers, but that one seems a bit pointless to me!

Change root/bank/instrument lists to single file for all instances.

Make loading effect presets update the 'top' line.

Startup state load doesn't set buffersize correctly - partially resolved. Size is ignored if loaded when already running (which is reasonable).

Allow headless compilation.

Make things like Echo delay either floats or much higher resolution.

Consider enabling and disabling tooltips.

Make attempt to start second independent instance open a new one in running yoshimi instead - saves memory and more consistent.

RPNs (channel based)

101,0 (MSB)

100,0 Pitch bend range
100,1 Fine detune
100,2 Coarse detune

Improve Copy & Paste functionality.
