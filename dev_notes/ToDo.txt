BUG: When loading MIDI-Learn files from CLI startup, sometimes doesn't display text of first line.

BUG! If jack is selected for audio but there are no physical ports Yoshimi quits with CLI warning - should continue run with no audio and gui warning as well, or better still loop back to try alsa.

BUG! stand-alone GUI freezes and no further system changes if new instance started while instrument change in progress.

Minor bug Multi instances produce jack error reports when main instance closed, even if they have been closed first - been there since V 1.4.1 :(

GUI Oddity. Press spacebar on startup and you disable part 1 AddSynth engine.
From then on repeats the last action.

Add dynfilter filter types to prompt.
Never been done before :(

Add which engines are enabled in CLI list part.
In fact significantly re-write this!
