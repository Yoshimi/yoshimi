This is a test feature only accessible from the command line.

                            *** WARNING ***

There are virtually no error checks on this so you can easily crash Yoshimi with out of range values!

It mostly updates the GUI too.

Refer to "Yoshimi Control Numbers.ods" for control numbers and actions and "GUI_Interpretations.txt" for further explanations.

Also, see "Effect_Inserts" for the actual effect controllers and "Envelope_Inserts" for the envelope controller ranges.

Sections currently in place and tested:

Top level controls
Midi-learn - used for all operations
Main part controls - now used by GUI for writes
Controllers Window - now used by GUI for writes
MIDI learn editor window - used for all except incoming real MIDI
Kit edit window - now used by GUI for writes
AddSynth Editor - now used by GUI for writes
AddSynth Voice Editor
Subsynth Editor - now used by GUI for writes
Padsynth Editor
Oscillator
Resonance
Effects
LFOs
Filters
Envelopes

The remaining ones will display as if they had been written to, but won't actually change anything.

This matches the results from using the middle mouse button in the GUI (assuming it was enabled at build time). Commands that are purely within the GUI,e.g window changes are recognised but not acted on. It is expected that any alternative input system will store its own copies of such intermediate information so that they remain fully independent.

An alternative way to find out the correct command sequence is to click on a control with any button *except* the middle one. Trailing '255's can be ommitted if there are no following parameters set.

In some situations par2 is used as a miscMsg ID for passing text values between threads but synchronised via the RT thread.


The format is:

direct {value} {type} {control} {part} {kit} {engine} {insert} {parameter} {par2}

direct = the actual command name, must be typed in full.

value = the value that will be set, may be negative and floating point (looks for the decimal point).

type = a subset of the command type: 0 for read and 64 for write. Sending 1 will just echo the bytes you sent.
Sending 3 will turn it into a midi-learn command.

control = the number representing the control being changed or queried.

part = the number of the part being changed.

All the above are mandatory. The following must also be entered in sequence when needed.

kit = a part's kit number (if enabled otherwise zero).
      also used differently for effects.

engine = the synth engine being adjusted.

insert = harmonics, LFOs, filters etc.

parameter = subtype associated with some inserts.

par2 = an offset for some parameters.


A variation of the above is when you set flt_max as the value. This will be interpreted as requesting the min, max, and default values for the command, and using the same 'CommandBlock' struct will return them as short integers in the form:
limits.min
limits.max
limits.def (x10)

From the command line enter at least the first three characters of "limits" in place of both value and type.

Most of these up to 'engine' level are independently declared, all the rest have the values:
min = 0
max = 127
def = 0

def returns the actual default * 10. This is so that fractional values can be resolved. 0.5 comes up quite often. However the printed command line response will be the actual value. Default values (and the others) may be negative.

'data.type' is returned with the read/write bit (0x40) used to tell whether this control is MIDI-learnable, and the float/integer bit (0x80) is correctly identified. All the other bits are returned as sent.
