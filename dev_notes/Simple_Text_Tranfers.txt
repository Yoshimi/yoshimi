This is intended for direct transfers of text between non-RT threads. Although sychronised and using miscMsg, these do not enter the Command functions at all. Par2 is used to carry the ID of the message (using miscMsg).

It is used mostly for setting names, but also for scales and keyboard mappings, which are string representations of number lists.

To identify such transfers Parameter has bit 7 set (ORed with 0x80). Nowhere else does this value appear and it can be readily masked out where needed. Once recognised it is passed to a separate function that does all the decoding, bypassing the normal control system. For some operations it can loop back into the 'returns' path to update the GUI or send replies to the CLI.

There are a few occasions where both the CLI and the GUI need a text update at the same time.As these are in different threads and MiscMsgPop is destructive, there is no way to tell which will get the message first. For these situations a duplicate massage is sent only to the CLI on the same data block using Value as the ID.
