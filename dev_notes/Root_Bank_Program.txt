The internal structure of this has changed so that you can set all three of these in a single call, always in the order; root, bank, program. However this full command is very pedantic and if either root or bank fault, program change will not be attempted. This is to protect against loading a same-name program from the wrong bank.

You can set these all singly, or any logical combination. On error, the returned message will be the first failed one.

You can also load a program from a file name by pushing it to the TextMsgBuffer and giving the returned ID to par2.

All unused parameters should be set to UNUSED (currently 255).

If you are setting just root and bank (and it succeeds) only the bank will be named, but the root ID will be shown.


*** This has been changed yet again ***

Program changes are now handled by a completely separate function, but bank and root are still combined.
