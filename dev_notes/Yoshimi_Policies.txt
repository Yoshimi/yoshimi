Yes! We actually have Yoshimi code policies. Look how many there are :)

If the version string contains a 4th number this will always be just a bugfix, and will never have features added or changed from the main version.

e.g
yoshimi-1.3.5   {main version}
yoshimi-1.3.5.1 {first bugfix}
yoshimi-1.3.5.2 {second bugfix} surely not!



We won't accept fixes for spelling errors in the *code*
For a start, from bitter experience it is fatally easy to change two variables to the same name! Also, there's no point, after all they are only a mnemonic for memory addresses etc. 'volume' and 'LFO' could just as well be 'turnyfing' and 'derfingwotwiggles'.



To avoid possible confusion, from now on 'master' will display the last released version number (without bugfix digits) with an 'M' suffix - unless it is a release candidate in which case the suffix will be rc{n}.

e.g.
Release was yoshimi-1.3.5.2
master was shown as yoshimi-1.3.5 M

xml files created with this will have:
Major version 1
Minor version 3



If using Fluid to edit GUI files, please close all windows and collapse all menus *before* the last save. I know it's tedious, but it avoids storms of spurious 'changes' that make genuine ones harder to see.



Please try to avoid creating trailing whitespace.



We now implement a build number. This is only bumped up when I push new commits to master (both github and sourceforge) so may represent several actual commits.
