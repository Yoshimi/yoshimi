This is a means of exposing various controls to NRPNs.

All of the commands produce log output in a manner designed to be compatible with both the GUI reports window and with a CLI readline environment.

To access these, set NRPN MSB (CC 99) to 64 and NRPN LSB (CC 98) to 2 (8130). After that send the following Data values. The command with LSB x doesn’t actually use Data LSB, but you still needs to send it.

    2         key         Set master key shift, key-64 (-36 to +36)
