This command is not documented in the User Guide as it is intended only for test
purposes. It intentionally performs no error checks itself so it's possible to
discover the response to values that should never normally be set. For this reason
it is sent via sendDirect() so that no preliminary adjustments are made.

It is used to populate a command block with raw byte values in the normal sequence
starting from 'control' It simply performs a read of the given data reporting the
results to either the GUI console window, or the CLI stdout, so reflects what a user
would see.

Entries:
    control
    part
    kit
    engine
    insert
    parameter
    offset

Currently we don't use 'miscmsg'. Also 'type' and 'source' are fixed.
