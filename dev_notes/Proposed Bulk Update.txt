A normal syncronised request would be made, and this would immediately be passed to a low priority thread.

This would then generate all the necessary data blocks for the update and *only* send them to whichever source requested them via it's ring buffer but without re-syncing.

Possible requested controls
Update Config
Update Bank Root
Update Bank List
Update Instruments in Bank

Update Main
Update Sys/Ins Effects

Update Part (top level and Controllers)
Update Part Effects and Kit

Update AddSynth (base)
Update AddSynth Voice
Update Addsynth Oscillators (Voice and Modulator)

Update SubSynth

Update PadSynth (base)
Update PadSynth Oscillators (main and Modulator)


Possibly optionally allow tree like traverse eg:
GUI update of a part could also fetch associated effects and complete engines but only if associated windows were open.
