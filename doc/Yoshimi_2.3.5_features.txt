Version 2.3.5

The SubSynth engine now has a set of LFOs matching the behaviour
of the other two engines. The user guide has been updated accordingly.

Envelope 'freemode' points can now be MIDI-Learned.

Popup tooltip overlays rescale to match the size of the parent window.

Corrected the issue where disabling the GUI was immediate, and could
only be restored from the CLI.

There has been further refinement of the underlying code to improve
reliability and make the code more consistent, and retain compatibility
with source code libraries.

Some more instruments have been added to the default banks.
