Version 2.3.5

The SubSynth engine now has a set of LFOs matching the behaviour
of the other two engines. The user guide has also been updated.

Popup tooltip windows rescale the match the size of the parent window.

There has been further refinement of the underlying code to improve
reliability and make the underlying code more consistent and retain
compatibility with source code libraries.
