      <ul>
      <li>
          <b>Category</b> Filter category: Analog, Formant or State Variable (StateVar)
      </li>
      <li>
          <b>St.</b> Filter stages (1 to 5)
      </li>
      <li>
          <b>Filter Type or Edit</b> This depends on the selected filter category. For Analog and StateVar various filters can be selected. For Formant a window enabling you to graphically edit the formants is opened
      </li>
      <li>
          <b>C.freq/BS.pos</b> Centre Frequency for Analog and StateVar. Base position of the vowel sequence for Formant
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Q</b> Q factor for the filter
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>V.SensA.</b> Velocity sensing. How much the filter is influenced by (MIDI) velocity of the note
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>V.Sns.</b> Velocity sensing function
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Gain</b> Filter output gain
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Freq.tr.</b> Amount of frequency tracking for the filter. If this is positive (rightmost) higher note frequencies will shift the filter cutoff frequency higher. Default range is -100% to 98% unless the checkbox above ('0 / +') is selected: in this case the range is 0% to 198%

    <p>
    When the formant window is selected, the <em>FilterType</em> list is replaced by an Edit button, and clicking on this opens the window shown. These controls are <em>additional</em> to the others and adjust individual formants and the vowels they are contained in.  Also, remember that the formant filter interacts with the filter envelope.

    For a deep understanding of formant filtering there is a highly detailed Wikipedia article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formant">Here</a>.

    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Formants</b> The number of active formants.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Fr.Sl</b> (formant slowness) The rate at which one formant morphs to the next.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Vw.Cl</b> (vowel clearness) The rate at which vowels transition.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Vowel no.</b> The vowel being edited.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Formant</b> The formant being edited.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Freq</b> The frequency of the current formant. Uniquely this has no default value, and will be set randomly at the time the filter is first set.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Q</b> The current formant's Q factor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Amp</b> The amplitude of the current formant.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Seq.Size</b> (sequence size) The number of active vowels.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>S.Pos.</b> (sequence position) The order of the vowels.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Vowel</b> The vowel number at the sequence position shown.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Strch</b> (stretch) Changes the time of the overall sequence.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Neg.Input</b> Inverts the input from the Envelope and/or LFO.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>C.f.</b> (centre frequency) The centre point of the complete filter.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Oct.</b> (octaves) The pitch range of the complete filter.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>The Formant Graph</h4>
    You can control some of the parameters by placing the mouse pointer over the yellow lines representing each formant. While making changes, the respective controls will move accordingly.
    <br><br>
    Holding down either <em>left</em> or <em>right</em> mouse buttons and moving the mouse sideways will change the formant's center frequency.
    <br><br>
    Moving vertically while holding down the <em>left</em> button will change the amplitude. Alternatively holding down the <em>right</em> button changes the formant's Q factor.
    <br><br>
    Anywhere on the graph, the <em>scroll-wheel</em> changes the octave range, and holding <em>Shift</em> at the same time changes the center frequency.
    <br><br>
    If your mouse has extra buttons on the sides (many haven't) these can be used to switch between the formants instead of moving the mouse across to the next one.
    <br><br>
    This is especially useful for controling most of the formant features one-handed, quickly, while also playing on a keyboard.
