Using NRPNs Yoshi can now directly set some part values regardless of what channel that part is connected to.

Set NRPN
 MSB = 64 {same as for vectors}, LSB = 0  [8128]

then (all value ranges start from zero, not 1)

Data MSB (6)
    0 : data LSB = part number
                    this obviously has to be set first

    1 : data LSB = program number

    2 : data LSB = controller number
                    carried over between calls

    3 : data LSB = controller value

    4 : data LSB = part's channel number
                    16 - 31 only allows note off for this part
                    > 31 disconnects the part from all channel messages

    5 : data LSB = part's audio destination
                    1 = main L&R
                    2 = direct L&R
                    3 = both
                    all other values ignored

   64 (0x40) : data LSB = key shift value
                    64 = no shift

Other values currently ignored.
