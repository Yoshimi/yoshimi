Using NRPNs Yoshi can now directly set some part values regardless of what channel that part is connected to.

Set NRPN
 MSB = 64 {same as for vectors}, LSB = 0  [8128]
 
then (all value ranges start from zero, not 1)

Data MSB (6)
    0 : data LSB = part number          {this obviously has to be set first}
    1 : data LSB = program number
    2 : data LSB = controller number
    3 : data LSB = controller value
    4 : data LSB = part's channel number {15 to 127 disconnects the part from any channel}
    5 : data LSB = part's audio destination
                    1 = main L&R
                    2 = direct L&R
                    3 = both
                    all other values ignored
                    

   35 (0x23) : data LSB = controller LSB value {not yet implemented}

Other values currently ignored.
