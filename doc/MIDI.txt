     There is now an option for making Program Change enable a part if it's currently disabled.

* different to the official GM spec.

The modulation wheel only affects AddSynth and PadSynth, and then only the frequency LFO depth. Just to make it more confusing, it changes the level from 0 up to it's current (gui) setting only. Therefore if the LFO depth is set to zero the Mod Wheel will have no effect.

User selectable CC for Bank Root Path change.

For more details of bank changes see Banks.txt

Instruments inside banks should always have four digits followed by a hyphen. Otherwise the results can be rather uinpredicatable.
