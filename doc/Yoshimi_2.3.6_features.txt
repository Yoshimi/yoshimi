Version 2.3.6

We've been particularly busy making sure that Yoshimi can work with both old and new versions of FLTK and MXML. Both of these have made breaking changes.
At the same time we've ensured that Yoshimi can run under the wayland windowing system.
There were some false positives regarding the identification of edited instruments. We now make a distinction between instrument and part controls. Part controls are not read back by an instrument load, but are in patchset and state files.

There was an anomaly in the main window where on odd occasions the F.BPM value became obscured/missing. This has now been resolved.

There have been more refinements of the underlying code improving reliability and consistency.
