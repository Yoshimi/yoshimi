The AddSynth voices and modulators have extremely complex relationships!

The names of the voice and modulator oscillator selections have been changed, as previously they were very confusing. Also the oscillator selectors for voice/modulator 1 have all been greyed out, as they don't do anything. You can only ever select Internal/Local, or one from a lower numbered voice.

The modulator numbers are syncronised to the voice numbers, so Mod. 3 will be defined by the settings in Voice 3 modulation editor.

It's important to understand that oscillators always exist even if they aren't used!

If you set up voice 2 as a square wave, and voice 1 as a triangle wave then set voice 3 to voice 2, voice 3 will get a square wave.

If you then set voice 2 to voice 1, voice 2 will get a triangle wave but voice 3 will still get a square wave.

Voice 3 can use the oscillator from voice one, even if voice 1 is switched off.

Modulator 3 can use the oscillator from modulator 1 even if modulator 1 is switched off, but modulator 3 can't use voice 1 if voice 1 is switched off.

However, if voice 2 is using the oscillator from voice 1, and modulator 3 is using voice 2, it will still get voice 2 oscillator.
