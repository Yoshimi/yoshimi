V 1.5.4 - Blackbird
Singer and mimic with a clear strong voice.

This is a very small release feature-wise but with a lot of cleanups in the code.

It is now possible to MIDI-learn *all* rotary controllers. Also there is a new one in the small MIDI controls window. This is master bandwidth (CC75) and is most effective on instruments with a rich set of harmonics - especially SubSynth.

Some of the tooltips were a bit ambiguous, and these have been changed to be more obvious.

We now include "The Yoshimi Advanced User Manual" as a PDF, which when installed will be placed in /usr/local/share/yoshimi. If you have a preferred PDF reader installed, then you can fetch it from the 'Yoshimi' dropdown menu.
