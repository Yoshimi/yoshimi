  'source' has up to 14 unique IDs + all and none.
  It also now carries routing information and has
  one spare bit.

  The control block has three spare bytes.

* Startup display now working.
* Set version as 1.5.11 rc3

2019-5-7 Will

2019-5-5 Will
* Completed padSynth parameter conversions.

  These had been set numerically in multiple locations.
* More transfers from 'using namespace' to 'std::'

2019-4-24 Will
* Added tooltips to master and part VU meters.

  through tring to start multiple instances at
  the same time.

2019-4-23 Will
* Removed redundant 'detach' thread element.

* Further small CLI refinements.

2019-4-15 Will
* Implemented CLI MIDI controllers.
  This had been forgotten :(

2019-4-14 Will

2019-02-10 Rob
* put FLTK sources & libs back in old places in CMakeLists -- tacking
  the libs on at end of the list sometimes broke linker command line.

* Enabled full CLI start sequence .state .xmz .xiz .xly
  but can be either jack session or state not both.

2019-1-24 Will
* Complex float rounding towards zero now just int(n).
  Rationale: This in most cases restores the original
  Zyn 2.2.1 method. Also, the assembler hack used to get
  faster performance is not portable across CPU types.
  These conversion were all for positive only values so
  there is no +- zero issue and the int+truncf combination
  is *much* slower than just int, yet does exacly the same.

2019-1-23 Will
* Removed all remaining mutex references.
  Already almost entirely commented out.

2019-1-22 Will
* BugFix: missing 'else' so CLI filter not seeing L1/H1.

  our settings as a prefix to existing CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS
  so the distro values take priority.
* Changed Examples/synth_prelude files to link to original.
  Done to avoid possible licensing issues.
* Added new warning file to dev_notes about spelling errors.

* Inplemented a new prng with no external libraries
  based on "A small noncryptographic PRNG"
  by Bob Jenkins

2018-11-27 Will

2015-1-5 Andrew
- MIDI bank root dir change algorithm now uses low priority threads
- MIDI bank root dir and bank changes are synchronized now
- GUI is updated accordingly to bank root dir changes


2015-1-5 Will
- MIDI bank root change now in place :)
  but not currently updating GUI :(
- Setting of both root and extended program CC now error checked
  but have to use the spinner up/down arrows - can't seem to
  reognise the 'Return' key :?

2015-1-3 Andrew
- Started control interface implementation
  (logging this for history)

2015-1-3 Will
- Added warnings if loading patches named 'Simple'Sound.
- Applied patch from Harry Nakos
  Volume & Pan now synchronised between main window and panel.

2015-1-3 Andrew
- Corrected target lib suffix detection for lv2 plugin

2015-1-2 Will
- Bank root IDs can now be changed in GUI.
- Cleaned up code.

2015-1-1 Will
- Settings->Bank root dirs now displays root IDs and marks
  current root and MIDI banks changes only see current root.

2014-12-21 Will
- Changed concept of default root dir to current root dir.
  current root is where new banks are saved to.
  changing current doesn't alter list order or root ID.
  ID will be used for MIDI root dir setting & bank access.

2014-12-11 Will
- Updated parameter & instrument load & save
    will not save 'empty' files
    inserts "No Title" when loading untitled instruments

2014-12-9 Andrew
- lv2 plugin: fixed ringbuffer write when midi message
  should be splitted into chunks (this is a very rare condition)

yoshimi-1.3.1

2014-12-8 Will
- A few optimisations in Reverb and Phaser
- Released V 1.3.1

2014-12-8 Andrew
- Separated LV2 plugin instances.
  Yoshimi - stereo mix,
  Yoshimi-Multi - stereo mix + 32 individual mono (16 stereo) channels.

2014-12-6 Will
- Corrected long standing bug in unison. Reverb bandwidth OK now!

2014-12-6 Andrew
- Added multi-channel support for lv2 plugin

2014-12-5 Will
- Reverb and Phaser additions
  Reverb bandwidth control sending right numbers
    but not changing the sound produced :(
  Phaser additions work correctly, but GUI controls
    Analog, Hyp., Dist. not sychronised :(
- Phaser done (silly mistake)

2014-12-1 Andrew
- Enabled cross-instance copy and paste.

yoshimi-1.3.0
- Made LV2 plugin ON by default
- Removed command line control. The reason: useless, not thread-safe code
- Just a few GUI improvements
- Made support for variable length runs. This provides sample-accurate midi processing
  for offline rendering and lv2 plugin.
- Removed strict requirements of Subnote on 8x multiple buffer size.
  Adopted SUBnote::filter() method for variable-length runs
- Initial LV2 plugin support (OFF by default)! Tested in MusE, Ardour 3,
  Carla and qtractor  - works both plugin and gui.
- replaced all calls to lrint() with (int)truncf(). When fesetround(FE_TOWARDZERO)
  was called, lrintf() behaves exactly as (int)truncf() with that difference, that
  (int)truncf() returns always the same result not depending on external factors.
- Made command line control for yoshimi instances (OFF by default)
- Added error message if midi bank changs too close
- Ported portamento rate and depth to controllers from Zyn.
- Added state interface support for lv2 interface. now saving/restoring
  yoshimi lv2 plugin settings works.
- Added per instance ability to change panel window between 2x8 or 1x16.
  Haven't decided on best way to store setting.
- Fixed bug in wide panel window.
- panel settings saved to yoshimi.config.
- patch provided by xnakos fixes part enable sync between panel and main window.
  This revealed it wasn't done properly for MIDI so that's been added too.
- removed spammy default midi messages.
- patch provided by xnakos to fix bug in Simple Sound representation.
- better resolution yoshimi icon.
- instrument updates.
- separated out examples from presets and put in their own directory.
- a few more GUI adjustments.

yoshimi-1.2.5
- Made yoshimi support multiple in-process instances:
  1) Added "New instance" menu item in "Yoshimi" submemu.
  2) Jack/alsa midi/audio port names are named "yoshimi" + postfix
     (empty for the first instance and -1,-2,-3 etc.. for the next).
  3) Windows names (main window, panel, keyboad) are named according
     to instance number with unique postfix.
  4) Only main window of the first instance exits process. Other windows
     deregister instances and closed.

- CMake policy change to stop warning message
- Small correction in part peak representation
- Copied some ancient history into Docs
- Part name always shows at least the words 'Simple Sound' so new users will
  know what it does.
- Bank selector always shows a name.
- MIDI Bank changes now refresh the bank window contents.
- There is now a compile time switch to direct errors to the console window
  instead of stderr.

- Moved all global variables to per-instance ones.
- Implemented multi-instance support:
  Updated all constructors to take SynthEngine * as last argument and store it
  in synth member variable. "Runtime" global var (of type Config*) and "guiMaster"
  (of type MasterUI *) are moved to SynthEngine and accessible via SynthEngine::getRuntime()
  (which returns reference to per-instance Config class) and SynthEngine::getGuiMaster()
  (which creates, if not already created, and returns per-instance MasterUI class).
  PresetsUI class instance is moved from global var to MasterUI class member var
  and accessible via synth->getGuimaster()->getPresetsUi() method from UI classes.
- Jack client instances will be named on per-instance basis.
  Default one is "yoshimi" + "->optional tag" (as before),
  next is "yosmimi-<optionoal tag>-<instance number>" starting at "1".
  This may never be used (but who knows? Anyway, this is the more proper way),
  because the default behavior for the yoshimi app is to create one global
  SynthEngine instance to go on with it till exit. From the user point of view
  nothing changed.
- Gui class destructors made virtual to make recent compilers happy
- Started initial LV2 plugin interface implementation (cmake option is OFF by default)

yoshimi-1.2.4

- ALSA MIDI can now auto-connect.
- Changed x.x.x.notes to Changelog as requested by packagers.
- Jack MIDI auto-connects too!
- VU meters disengaged from synth via ring buffer.
- Failing to load parameters or instruments at startup is no longer fatal.
- Yoshimi accepts un-numbered instruments in banks again - under protest!
- Some more small UI and CL message refinements.
- In settings added Enable/Disable MIDI program change - some seq's don't play nice :(
  default is to enable. Compatible with Zyn's 'ignore program change'.
- Settings layout tidied up.
- Incremental DSP improvement - we now only fill/copy buffers that have a destination!
- Bugfix - when a part's audio out was directed to part only, system effects were still
  being generated and sent to main.
- Correction - audio to part *does* carry insertion effects if they are set.
- VU calculations now completely separated from sound generation and outside the mutex lock.
- Changed envelope cut-off to -60dB (was -40).
- Another addition to Will_Godfrey_Companion bank :)
- Bugfix - missing 'include' in main.cpp stopped compilation - but not in all environments!
- Changed unison size highlighting. With no code change, it stopped working for some reason!
- Improved VU displays.
- Updated INSTALL instructions and removed duplicates of this and COPYING in /src
- detached part outputs from main volume and added clip indication in panel (doesn't
  clear with 'Stop' so fundged)
- some more minor adjustments
- VU updates completed - and we're away!


yoshimi-1.2.3

- Some more minor bug fixes.
- INSTALL file now refers to V1.2.2
- Enabled saving audio destination in parameters file
    only relevant for jack output.
- Ported SubSynth overtones feature from Zyn. 2.4.4
- Ported Unison phase randomisation control from Zyn. 2.4.4
- Added checkbox in 'Settings' to allow a MIDI program change
  to enable a part if it was previously disabled.
- Ported AddSynth & SubSynth processing enhancements from Zyn. 2.4.4
- Changed part's key limit from a list to a spinner so you can set
  any value up to the maximum poliphony - 5
  This is error checked when parameter files are loaded.
- Changed unison size from a list to an enable button and spinner
  giving you finer grained control.
  Values that match ZynAddSubFX are highlighted for compatibilty
- Added experimental 'naturalise' small random detune feature at note-on.
- Performed lots of tiny optimsations.
- Disabled part audio out selection if not running jack.
- Put some more info in Docs - much more to do!
- Updated copyright notices.
- Temporarily disabled ALSA MIDI auto connect till I can find out why
  it crashes - seems it's never worked.


yoshimi-1.2.2

- Started some documentation. Much more needed!
- Improved config saving. I think we're there now :)
- Fixed bug that caused segfault if MIDI voice changed with no GUI.
- Fixed bug that stopped MIDI bank change with no GUI.
- Added panel option to direct a part's audio to only main, only part or both.
- Cleaned up panel display.
- Added memory lock to jack ringbuffer (probably not needed).
- Restored PADsynth highlights and made them more distinct.
- Refined PADsynth and general boolean XML detection a little.
- Enabled reporting to console. It doesn't seem to affect CPU usage.
- Improved error reporting for missing bank or program.
- Added Test directory with MIDI and Rosegarden bank and program change files.
- Reinstated gzip compression on voice and parameter files.
- Added compression level to settings. 0 = plain XML save.
- Bug fix. Controllers window would sometimes freeze - thanks to Rob Couto for the fix.
- Added appdata as requested in the sourceforge features tickets.
- Revised 'make install' to make sure everything goes to the right place.
- Changed position of Pitch bend roller in Vkeyboard to make things clearer.
- Small update to Will_Godfrey_Companion bank.
- Reinstated part Pan Depth control, but calling it Pan Width as that's more descriptive.


yoshimi-1.2.1

- Added alternative robot icon as an SVG. Thanks to Andrew Ter-Grigoryan
- Added option to enable a part if not already enabled, when doing a MIDI program change.
- Set Vkeyboard default velocity to 100 same as for ZynAddSubFX.
- Stopped settings asking twice about saving. Will do more on this!
- Rationalised linker flags.
- Added drumkits from Dario Straulino.


yoshimi-1.2.0

Added circle and spike AddSynth Waveshapes.

Added MIDI bank and program change. Bank change can be selected as MSB, LSB or disabled. Included CC for patches 128 to 160. Also CC selectable and can be disabled.

Finally resolved trailing zeros in detune bug.
Fixed microtonal saving bug.

Corrected parameter loading regression (that mainly affected the Overdrive sound).

Corrected regression that stopped the -K option autoconnecting

Other small bug fixes.

Added and updated voice patches.
